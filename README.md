# FeeloChat

FeeloChat is a **privacy-focused, end-to-end encrypted** chat application that goes beyond text-based communication. It integrates **Face API.js** to detect and share facial expressions in real-time, allowing users to express their emotions more authentically while chatting.

With FeeloChat, your conversations remain **secure and private**, as expression detection happens **locally on your device** before being shared. This ensures that your facial data is never stored or sent to external servers. The app is designed to work seamlessly across **mobile and desktop devices**, supporting all screen resolutions.
